## Tradim

Tradim.io is our proprietary NFT marketplace on Nova Network. Powerful, yet simple, it brings to the table a tailored UI that allows even those unfamiliar with the space to use the platform with ease.

## SMUI
**Website:** https://smui.novanetwork.io/  
**For Developers:** [Public Repository](https://github.com/nova-network-inc/smui)  

SMUI is a powerful development tool that allows developers to connect and interact directly with any smart contract deployed on **Nova Network** or **Nebula Testnet**. It bypasses the need for any additional UI, and users can call the contract functions using a simple ABI `json` file.

## Nebula Testnet Faucet
**Website:** https://faucet.novanetwork.io/  
**For Developers:** [Public Repository](https://github.com/nova-network-inc/faucet)  

Nebula Testnet Faucet is used by developers to acquire testnet NBX tokens so they can pay for network usage fees and test functions in their development environment. If you need NBX in quantities higher than allowed by the faucet, please get in touch with our support team for assistance.

## SSL Proxy
**For Developers:** [Public Repository](https://github.com/nova-network-inc/ssl-proxy)  

This is a very simple SSL Proxy developed by our team for easy deployment of public and private Nova Network RPCs. It uses NodeJS to redirect between different ports of a host, using SSL to enable communication via `https` even for protocols without native support for it.
